//	Floor division	x // y

3.
Operator	Name			Example
==	       Equal			x == y	
!=	     Not equal			x != y	
>	   Greater than			x > y	
<	     Less than			x < y	
>=	 Greater than or equal to	x >= y

4.
Operator	Description						Example
and 	Returns True if both statements are true			x < 5 and  x < 10	
or	Returns True if one of the statements is true			x < 5 or x < 4	
not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true		not(x < 5 and x < 10)

5.
Operator	Description						Example
is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object		x is y	
is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object		x is not y

6.
Operator	Description									Example	Try it
in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object		x in y	
not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

7.
Operator	Name	        Description											    Example	
& 	    AND			Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1									x & y	
|	    OR			Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1								x | y	
^	    XOR			Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1								x ^ y	
~	    NOT			Inverts all the bits											~x	
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off			x << 2	
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2

8.
Parentheses has the highest precedence, meaning that expressions inside parentheses must be evaluated first:
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))

Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +, and therefore multiplications are evaluated before additions:
print(100 + 5 * 3)

9.
Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefore we evaluate the expression from left to right:
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
